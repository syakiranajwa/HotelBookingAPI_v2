#Hotel booking System API

## Basic Features
- List All rooms and available rooms
- Book room
- Display all bookings

##Bonus Feature Added
- View available rooms based on dates 
	- because I use date range , so, the isAvailable method will not be used because 
	  the room can be booked for other dates
- Cancel Bookings 
- The room can be booked for different dates
